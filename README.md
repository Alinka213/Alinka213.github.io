WELCOME to ALINKA231'S HOMEPAGE

Here we are learning how to use Github to create our own web-sites and then how to edit them. Moreover we are training how to frade them with different themes. That is useful for the future life and for work  in the modern world.

I invite you to my self-organized Kinoforum. Use the link to join us.
